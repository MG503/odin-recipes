    You’ll only use one 200 g ball of dough and about 3 Tbsp. pizza sauce to make one pie, so you’ll have lots left over—with the best-ever excuse to invite people over for a pizza party. And with the amount of love, time, and research that went into making what constitutes the “perfect” pizza, you’ll definitely want to share. But you can also freeze the dough for up to two weeks to keep it on hand for whenever you need it.
    <h2>Pizza Dough Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g Central Milling Organic High Mountain flour</li>
        <li>150 g freshly milled flour (from Central Milling Organic Steel Cut Cracked Wheat) or Central Milling Organic High Mountain flour or high-quality whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>30 g Diamond Crystal kosher salt </li> 
        <li>300 g King Arthur all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Mix High Mountain flour, freshly milled flour, salt, and 600 g all-purpose flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook just to combine.</li>
<li>Whisk starter and 660 g room-temperature water in a large measuring glass to combine, then add oil and yeast and whisk until well blended.</li>
<li>Make a well in dry ingredients and pour in starter mixture. Mix on low speed, increasing speed to medium as dry ingredients are incorporated, until well combined. Scrape down sides of bowl and fold in any flour, if needed. Remove bowl from mixer and scrape dough from hook. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover dough and fit bowl back onto mixer. Mix on medium speed until you're able to pinch and stretch a small piece of dough between your fingers until translucent and doesn’t rip, about 10 minutes (dough should look sticky but cohesive, and it should be very elastic and jiggly). Transfer dough to a very large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot (near the oven is great) until 50 percent expanded in volume, about 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
